<br/>

Defining the Clinical Reporting Pipeline

A collaboration begins between Atorus and GSK

Open Source in a Regulated Environment

Overview of the 3 Packages – {metacore}, {logrx}, {xportr}

Welcome to the {pharmaverse}!

# Challenges of using an Open-Source Language in a Regulated Environment

.two-column[

  .left-col[

  **An Incomplete List of Challenges** 

  - SAS® processes have years of use within regulatory agencies and tend to take precedence.   

  - Company Firewalls and VPNs.  

  - Sharing of code and data. 

  - Does a R package bend to SAS® processes or does the package recreate/redefine the process?

  - Who maintains the open-source product?

  ]

  .right-col[

  **An Incomplete List of Solutions**

  - Github, Gitlab and etc. help us to share, fix and build up code in an interactive and version-controlled process.

  - R Consortium is working with the FDA to investigate delivering a submission in R.

  - R packages already out there that mimic some of SAS® processes – {haven}, {SASxport}

  - Pharma companies will have a vested interest in maintaining these packages.
  
  - New graduates are coming out of school with R and Python skills

# {metacore}

.right-col[
**Challenges for R in CRP**

- No available R packages that can ingest and parse metadata for clinical trial datasets or help build a define.xml.

**Solutions**

- Built functions for parsing xml data and other data types specific to clinical trial datasets.

- Functions and objects can be leveraged to help for dataset and variable creation as well as user for creating and codelist and derivations.

**Future development path**

- Working with different company's metadata files as well as in-development packages, e.g., admiral, to leverage metadata upstream or downstream.

# {logrx}

]

.right-col[
**Challenges for R in CRP**

- There is no SAS-like log file for R-based programs that show traceability and help to create audit-ready code.

**Solutions**

- Created a utilities and wrapper functions to capture user info, session information and warnings and errors in an easy-to-read format.

- Allows for recreation of script, not just the output.

**Future development path**

- Interactive display screen to batch submit multiple programs.

- What else should go in a log?  Companies might have different needs.

- Name changed to logrx - got to be quick!!

# {xportr}

![xportr](www/img/xportr_piped.png)


**Challenges for R in CRP**

- Writing a compliant xpt file using haven or other xpt-supported packages is challenging for types, lengths and labels

**Solutions**

- Adding well defined metadata
- Helps to write compliant xpt files
- Custom error, warnings and messages for information about metadata
- Checks on the data before final output

**Future development path**

- How to ingest metadata specifications from different companies and different file formats
