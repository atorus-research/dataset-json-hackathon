# xportrjson


# Purpose

This is a proof of concept R package developed for the CDISC Open-Source Alliance (COSA) Hackathon in the Fall of 2022.

## Motivation

Clinical Programmers and Statisticians need to be able to read in and write out data while working on SDTMs, ADaMs or TLFs.  We feel that a simple R package that has the ability to seamlessly read in and write out JSON dataset files will ease this burden of JSON adoption.  A Clinical Programmers or Statisticians can then easily use all their current tools within `{tidyverse}` and `{pharmaverse}` packages.
